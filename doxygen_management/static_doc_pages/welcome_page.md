Welcome to the lexLeo programming language project! This repository contains the source code for lexLeo's compiler and
interpreter, designed to explore and implement the capabilities of this new programming language.
**The full documentation is available online at [https://caltuli.online/lexleo](https://caltuli.online/lexleo).**

This project is primarily an educational initiative designed to deepen understanding and practical application of
fundamental programming language concepts, as well as the principles of compilers and interpreters. It aims to provide
an interactive learning platform where participants can explore the intricacies of language construction, understand the
stages of compilation, and master the process of interpretation.

The framework of this project allows students and computer enthusiasts to engage in a structured environment that
fosters skill development in language design, compiler construction, and the creation of efficient interpreters.

Beyond its pedagogical focus on programming languages and compilers, lexLeo is also a pretext for applying and refining
modern software engineering practices. The project emphasizes:

- Clean and scalable software architecture
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Robust build and dependency management using CMake
- Automated documentation generation with Doxygen

By adhering to these professional practices, lexLeo serves as a real-world playground for mastering not only theoretical
concepts, but also the tools, workflows, and discipline that underpin high-quality software development. The ultimate
goal is to cultivate both technical expertise and rigorous methodology, equipping contributors with skills that
translate directly into industry standards.

This project includes:

- **lexLeo Compiler**: Translates lexLeo code into an intermediate or target language.
- **lexLeo Interpreter**: Executes lexLeo code directly for rapid testing and development.
