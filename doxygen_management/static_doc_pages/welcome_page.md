Welcome to the lexLeo programming language project! This repository contains the source code for lexLeo's compiler and interpreter, designed to explore and implement the capabilities of this new programming language.

This project is primarily an educational initiative designed to deepen understanding and practical application of fundamental programming language concepts, as well as the principles of compilers and interpreters. It aims to provide an interactive learning platform where participants can explore the intricacies of language construction, understand the stages of compilation, and master the process of interpretation.

The framework of this project allows students and computer enthusiasts to engage in a structured environment that fosters skill development in language design, compiler construction, and the creation of efficient interpreters.

This project includes:

- **lexLeo Compiler**: Translates lexLeo code into machine code.
- **lexLeo Interpreter**: Executes lexLeo code directly for rapid testing and development.
